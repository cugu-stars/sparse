Golang implementation of simg2img. Written as a library that returns a io.Reader that decodes sparse android images into raw images. Includes example simg2img-cmd impl. that seems to work, but the resulting raw images are untested and failed my md5sum-test. Possibly because of how I handle DONT_CARE-type chunks (if the lib wrote the file itself, it could ignore DONT_CARE bytes instead of writing them to something random).
